XKCD FAVORITE VIEWER

A very simple React application that lets you view XKCD comics and choose your favorites.

To run the app, first run

npm install

then start the node proxy server by running

and then start the app by running

npm run dev

this will start up a node.js passthrough server to relay the requests to xkcd.com and then start a webpack dev server to serve up the local files.
